- 👋 Hi, I’m @Danas-github!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding Scratch projects, baking, and bullet journaling :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make projects on Github! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now, because I first want to learn coding in github :) If you really want to collab, we can do that on Scratch :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Go to my Scratch account [scratch.mit.edu/users/Danas_Bakery], feel free to leave a comment there ^^

✨Have a great day✨
